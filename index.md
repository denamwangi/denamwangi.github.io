title: Hi, I'm Dena
---

I'm a web developer and data geek. After graduating from Duke University with a **Masters in Economics**, I worked in International Development running the data side of field experiments and answering questions like "did all this money we spent make any difference at all?" (spoiler alert: _sometimes_). Most recently at the World bank.

I transitioned into tech in 2017 and currently spend my days at Pinterest as a full stack web developer thinking about how to make businesses successful on the platform while not getting in the way of users. My favorite types of businesses to think about are small businesses (we STAN). Just before Pinterest I spent a glorious few weeks nerding out in Brooklyn at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) - you should too.

 I have a passion for analytics and data as a tool to help us get a sense of the world around us. I love building things that illuminate what's typically unseen, using tech for good and generally advocating for equity. Other things I like: cats, coffee, cycling, social justice, building community.
