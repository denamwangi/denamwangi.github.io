title: Hi, I'm Dena
---

I'm a technologist, programmer, data enthusiast. See also: Kenyan, Feminist, [Afrobubblegum-ist](https://artsandculture.google.com/story/fun-fierce-and-frivolous/yAUhiqFO4o436g?hl=en).

I currently spend my day hours as an Engineering Manager for a Growth team at Pinterest where i've spent the last 3.5 ish years of my career - mostly as a full stack software engineer thinking about how to make businesses successful on the platform while not getting in the way of users. Just before Pinterest I spent a glorious few weeks nerding out in Brooklyn at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) - you should too! Seriously, you should too. Ask me about it.

Pre-tech life
I'm a big fan of personal reinvention and evolutions. After graduating from Duke with a Masters in Economics, I worked in International Development running the data side of field experiments and answering questions like "did all this money we spent make any difference at all?" (spoiler alert: _sometimes_). Most recently at the World bank. It's all related.

I have a passion for analytics and data as a tool to help us get a sense of the world around us. I love building things that illuminate what's typically unseen, using tech for good and generally advocating for equity. Other things I love: Beyonce, cats, coffee, (bi)cycling, social justice, building community.
