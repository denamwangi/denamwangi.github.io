title: Hi, I'm Dena
---

I'm a developer and data enthusiast. After graduating from Duke University with a **Masters in Economics**, I worked in International Development running the data side of field experiments and answering questions like "did all this money we spent make any difference at all?" (spoiler alert: _sometimes_). Most recently at the World bank.

I transitioned into tech in 2017 and have spent the last couple of years as a fullstack software engineer on the growth team (python && reactjs) at Sentry, an open source error monitoring tool. Currently i'm spending time nerding out in Brooklyn at the Recurse Center and blogging along my journey here.

 I have a passion for analytics and data as a tool to help us get a sense of the world around us. I love building things that illuminate what's typically unseen, using tech for good and generally advocating for equity. Other things I like: cats, coffee, bicycles, social justice, building community.
